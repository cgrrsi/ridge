# Ridge regression from scratch

## Linear least squares with l2 regularization

Goal = minimizing the objective function

$$\|y - X\beta\|^2_2 + \lambda * ||\beta||^2_2$$

This model solves a regression model where the loss function is the linear least squares function and regularization is given by the l2-norm.
